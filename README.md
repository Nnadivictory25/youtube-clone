i like adding these odd colors and outline during a project to help me to actually know how and where each element is positioned

# Finished product
This project was hard at first but I'm happy i approached the challenge the way I did , i dont even know how i was able to make this project as clean as it is, I must say ,   I'm very proud of myself and as time goes on hope to improve  better in this journey of becoming a FULL-STACK DEV
